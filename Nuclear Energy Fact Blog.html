       <br>
       <br>
   <p>
   
    <a class="fact11">#Fact.1 -</a><br><br><p class="fact1">In the United States, the first commercial nuclear generator was the Shippingport Reactor in Pennsylvania, which opened in 26 May,1958.</p>
    <br>
    <img class="fact1img" src="Web/Nuclearenergyfact1img.jpg"></img>
    <br><br><br>
    
    <a class="fact11">#Fact.2 -</a><br><br><p class="fact1">In 1905, Einstein discovered that mass could be changed into energy and vice versa. In 1918, Sir Ernest Rutherford showed that atoms could be split. By 1942, the world had its first nuclear reactor.</p>
    <br>
    <img class="fact1img" src="Web/Nuclearenergyfact2img.jpg"></img>
    <br><br><br>
    
    <a class="fact11">#Fact.3 -</a><br><br><p class="fact1">The most powerful nuclear device ever detonated by the United States (at 25 megatons) was Castle Bravo at the Bikini Atoll of the Marshall Islands on March 1, 1954. It was also the largest accidental radiological contamination caused by the U.S. It was about 1,000 times more powerful than each of the atomic bombs which were dropped on Hiroshima and Nagasaki during WWII. Castle Bravo was the fifth largest nuclear explosion in the world.</p>
    <br>
    <img class="fact1img" src="Web/Nuclearenergyfact3img.jpg"></img>
    <br><br><br>
    
    <a class="fact11">#Fact.4 -</a><br><br><p class="fact1">Between 1945 and 1996, over 2,000 nuclear tests were carried out globally. Between 1945 and 1992, the U.S. held over 1,032 tests. Between 1949 and 1990, the Soviet Union carried out 715 tests. Additionally, between 1952 and 1991, the UK carried out 45 tests. France carried out 210 tests between 1960 and 1996. China carried out 45 tests between 1964 and 1996.</p>
    <br>
    
    <br><br><br>
    
    <a class="fact11">#Fact.5 -</a><br><br><p class="fact1">The peace symbol was initially an anti-nuclear weapons symbol.</p>
    <br>
    <img class="fact1img" src="Web/Nuclearenergyfact5img.jpg"></img>
    <br><br><br>
    
    <a class="fact11">#Fact.6 -</a><br><br><p class="fact1">A nuclear power plant must shut down every 18-24 months to remove its used uranium fuel, or radioactive waste</p>
    <br>
   
    <br><br><br>
    
    <a class="fact11">#Fact.7 -</a><br><br><p class="fact1">The most powerful nuclear weapon ever detonated was Russia's Tsar Bomba. It is also the single most physically powerful device ever created by man. The fireball reached nearly as high as the altitude of the release plan and was seen 620 miles from ground zero. The mushroom cloud was over 40 miles high and the base of the cloud was 25 miles wide. It was test-denotated on October 30, 1961, in the Novaya Zemlya archipelago.</p>
    <br>
    <img class="fact1img" src="Web/Nuclearenergyfact7img.jpg"></img>
    <br><br><br>
    
    <a class="fact11">#Fact.8 -</a><br><br><p class="fact1">The world's first nuclear power plant to create electricity for a power grid was USSR's Obninsk Nuclear Power Plant, which opened on June 27, 1954.</p>
    <br>
    
    <br><br><br>
    
    <a class="fact11">#Fact.9 -</a><br><br><p class="fact1">A nuclear war would kill approximately 1 billion people, and hundreds of millions would be injured. The 3-4 billion people left alive would find themselves facing widespread radioactive contamination, a possible nuclear winter, increased levels of damaging ultraviolet rays due to partial destruction of the ozone layer, a global photochemical smog, as well as a multitude of toxic pollutants.</p>
    <br>
    
    <br><br><br>
    
    <a class="fact11">#Fact.10 -</a><br><br><p class="fact1">The first nuclear-powered surface vessel was the Russian icebreaker Lenin. The largest nuclear powered surface ship is the 1,122-foot-long USS Enterprise, which was launched in 1960. It is the longest naval vessel in the world and has eight reactors driving four propellers. It is still active.</p>
    <br>
    <img class="fact1img" src="Web/Nuclearenergyfact10img.jpg"></img>
    <br><br><br>
    
    <a class="fact11">#Fact.11 -</a><br><br><p class="fact1">J. Robert Oppenheimer, along with Enrico Fermi, is considered the "father of the atomic bomb." After the Trinity test in the United States in 1945, Oppenheimer quoted a line from the Bhagavad Gita: "Now, I am become death, the destroyer of the world.'.</p>
    <br>
    <img class="fact1img" src="Web/Nuclearenergyfact11img.jpg"></img>
    <br><br><br>
    
    <a class="fact11">#Fact.12 -</a><br><br><p class="fact1">The United States has 71,862 tons of nuclear waste. Waste can stay dangerous for tens of thousands of years. The industry's nuclear pile of waste is growing about 2,200 tons a year. Some waste sites contain four times the amount of spent fuel they were designed to handle.</p>
    <br>
    <img class="fact1img" src="Web/Nuclearenergyfact12img.jpg"></img>
    <br><br><br>
    
    <a class="fact11">#Fact.13 -</a><br><br><p class="fact1">South Africa developed complete nuclear weapons in the 1980s. However, it became the first country in the world to voluntarily destroy their weapon supply and to stop producing more weapons.</p>
    <br>
    
    <br><br><br>
    
    <a class="fact11">#Fact.14 -</a><br><br><p class="fact1">In the United States, radioactivity is often measured in rems. However, most countries currently use the sievert (Sv) to measure radioactivity. One sievert is equal to 100 rems. The nuclear waste from an entire reactor gives off about 10,000 rems per hour, even 10 years after it was first used in a nuclear plant. A human who is exposed to 500 rems at one time will die.</p>
    <br>
  
    <br><br><br>
    
    <a class="fact11">#Fact.15 -</a><br><br><p class="fact1">Nuclear power plants use nuclear fission, or the process of splitting an atom into two. Nuclear fusion (the process of combining atoms into one) is thought to be safer; however, nuclear fusion technology has not yet been developed on a wide scale.</p>
    <br>
    <img class="fact1img" src="Web/Nuclearenergyfact2img.jpg"></img>
    <br><br><br>
    
    <a class="fact11">#Fact.16 -</a><br><br><p class="fact1">Nuclear medicine uses radioactive isotopes (or radioisotopes) to study, diagnose, and treat diseases. Additionally, radiotherapy is used to treat many medical conditions, especially cancer, by using radiation to destroy targeted cells.</p>
    <br>
    
    <br><br><br>
    
    <a class="fact11">#Fact.17 -</a><br><br><p class="fact1">Today, 104 nuclear plants supply about 20% of the United State's electricity. The oldest plants have been operating since before 1979. There have been no new sites built since the Three Mile Island disaster (1979).</p>
    <br>
    <img class="fact1img" src="Web/Nuclearenergyfact17img.jpg"></img>
    <br><br><br>
    
    <a class="fact11">#Fact.18 -</a><br><br><p class="fact1">The United States primarily used the Nevada Test Site and the Marshall Islands (Pacific Proving Grounds) to test their atomic and nuclear weapons.</p>
    <br>
    
    <br><br><br>
    
    <a class="fact11">#Fact.19 -</a><br><br><p class="fact1">The first disastrous impact from nuclear energy occurred in August 1945 when the United States dropped two atomic bombs on Hiroshima and Nagasaki. Over 250,000 people, mostly civilians, died from the denotations.</p>
    <br>
    
    <br><br><br>
    
    <a class="fact11">#Fact.20 -</a><br><br><p class="fact1">The average cost of building one new reactor for a new plant in the United States is between $6 and $8 billion.</p>
    <br>
  
    <br><br><br>
    
    <a class="fact11">#Fact.21 -</a><br><br><p class="fact1">Uranium is a source of today's nuclear fuel. During the Middle Ages, craftspeople used it to color glass yellow or certain shades of green.</p>
    <br>
    <img class="fact1img" src="Web/Nuclearenergyfact21img.jpg"></img>
    <br><br><br>
    
    <a class="fact11">#Fact.22 -</a><br><br><p class="fact1">Some scientists estimate that a person receives five times as much radiation in a lifetime from sitting in front of the TV or computer as he or she would from living by a nuclear power station.</p>
    <br>
    <img class="fact1img" src="Web/Nuclearenergyfact22img.jpg"></img>
    <br><br><br>
    
    <a class="fact11">#Fact.23 -</a><br><br><p class="fact1">Currently, nuclear waste in the United States is stored in cooling pools of water and in dry storage casks at nuclear power plants. The United States government, however, hopes to bury its waste deep underground at Yucca Mountain, Nevada. Nevadans and surrounding states have protested this proposal.</p>
    <br>
    
    <br><br><br>
    
    <a class="fact11">#Fact.24 -</a><br><br><p class="fact1">The largest radioactive waste storage pool in the U.S. is in North Carolina at the Shearon Harris nuclear plant. The department of Homeland Security had marked Shearon Harris as one of the most vulnerable terrorist targets in the nation.</p>
    <br>
   
    <br><br><br>
    
    <a class="fact11">#Fact.25 -</a><br><br><p class="fact1">There have been three major nuclear power plant disasters: the Chernobyl disaster (1986), the Three Mile Island accident (1979), and the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster (2011).</p>
    <br>
  
    <br><br><br>
    
    <a class="fact11">#Fact.26 -</a><br><br><p class="fact1">After Japan's nuclear disaster in 2011, several countries have rethought the use of nuclear energy. For example, Germany plans to close all of its reactors by 2022. Italy and Switzerland have halted expanding their nuclear power. However, some big markets, such as China and India, are still pushing ahead with new nuclear plants.</p>
    <br>
  
    <br><br><br>
    
    <a class="fact11">#Fact.27 -</a><br><br><p class="fact1">Of the 2,000 nuclear explosions detonated over the world between 1954 and 1996, 25% (over 500 bombs) were detonated in the atmosphere. The majority has been detonated underground. In fact, 75% of all nuclear tests during the Cold War were detonated underground.</p>
    <br>
    
    <br><br><br>
    
    <a class="fact11">#Fact.28 -</a><br><br><p class="fact1">The Chernobyl disaster released a hundred times more radiation than the atom bombs dropped on Nagasaki and Hiroshima in WWII. The environmental group Greenpeace says its research shows that the death toll will be near 100,000.</p>
    <br>
    <img class="fact1img" src="Web/Nuclearenergyfact28img.jpg"></img>
    <br><br><br>
    
    <a class="fact11">#Fact.29 -</a><br><br><p class="fact1">The Sun produces an enormous amount of energy from its nuclear reactions that change hydrogen into helium. In the process, the Sun loses over 4 million tons of mass - every second.</p>
    <br>
    <img class="fact1img" src="Web/Nuclearenergyfact29img.jpg"></img>
    <br><br><br>
    
    <a class="fact11">#Fact.30 -</a><br><br><p class="fact1">Fossil fuels supply about 90% of the world's electricity. These fuels emit dangerous gasses such as carbon dioxide, sulfur dioxide, and nitrogen oxide, which create acid rain and may contribute to global warming. Nuclear energy does not directly add harmful gases to the atmosphere, but nuclear plants are expensive to build and create radioactive materials.</p>
