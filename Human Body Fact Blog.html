Women also have about 10 times more white matter than men.</p>

     <a class="fact11">#Fact.9 -</a><br><br><p class="fact1">Colors in dreams can be interpreted only in the context of the dreamer's relationship with that color.

     <a class="fact11">#Fact.12 -</a><br><br><p class="fact1">Night terrors, or parasomnia, are not the same as nightmares.

     <a class="fact11">#Fact.17 -</a><br><br><p class="fact1">Advertisers use mind illusions to make their products more appealing. For example, they produce condiment bottles with long necks because the mind is better at judging size than volume. Bottles of maple syrup are narrow at the base but bulge in the middle because that is where a person is most likely to look.</p>

       <br>
 
       <br><br><br> 
     <a class="fact11">#Fact.25 -</a><br><br><p class="fact1">Types of triggers that humans are evolutionarily prepared to fear, such as caged snakes, evoke a visceral response even though humans know they are relatively harmless on a cognitive level. However, humans are less likely to react with fear to dangerous risks that evolution has not prepared them for, such as hamburgers, smoking, and unsafe sex, even though most people recognize the danger on a cognitive level.</p>

     <a class="fact11">#Fact.33 -</a><br><br><p class="fact1">Solomon Shereshevsky was a Russian journalist who couldn't forget. He suffered from synesthesia, a phenomenon in which one sense (for example, vision) stimulates another sense (such as hearing). Solomon's extreme synesthesia led him to taste, smell, and see vivid images in conjunction with numbers and sounds. Because a single word could trigger a flood of memories and associations, he had a difficult time reading a book or having a simple conversation.</p>
