       <br>
       <br>
   <p>
     <a class="fact11">#Fact.1 -</a><br><br><p class="fact1">Every year, as much as 400,000 tons of cosmic material heads toward Earth. Fortunately, most of it burns up in our atmosphere. Scientists call objects "meteoroids" before they reach Earth's atmosphere. If they burn up in the atmosphere, they are called "meteors." Objects that reach Earth's surface are called "meteorites.'</p>
       <br>
       <img class="fact1img" src="Web/Spacefact1img.jpg"></img>
      <br><br><br>
     <a class="fact11">#Fact.2 -</a><br><br><p class="fact1">Scientists estimate that there may as many as 20 trillion galaxies in our universe.</p>
       <br>
       <img class="fact1img" src="Web/Spacefact2img.jpg"></img>
       <br><br><br>
     <a class="fact11">#Fact.3 -</a><br><br><p class="fact1">Most researchers believe that Mars' surface was shaped by catastrophic floods billions of years ago. Scientists are unclear on what form water may have taken early in Mars' history. One theory is that early Mars was warmer and boasted rain and oceans. Another theory is that Mars was always very cold, but water trapped underground as ice was periodically released when heating caused the ice to melt and gush to the surface. No one knows what happened to the water on Mars. Many scientists speculate that Mars' water may have been lost into space if the atmosphere of Mars thinned out over many eons. Large quantities of water, in either ice or liquid form, are thought to be still trapped underneath its surface.</p>
       <br>
       <img class="fact1img" src="Web/Spacefact3img.jpg"></img>
       <br><br><br>
     <a class="fact11">#Fact.4 -</a><br><br><p class="fact1">Until recently, it was thought that Mars' polar caps were made from carbon dioxide (dry ice) with only a small amount of water. Later observations indicated that the polar caps were mostly frozen water with a thin layer of carbon dioxide.</p>
       <br>
       <img class="fact1img" src="Web/Spacefact4img.jpg"></img>
       <br><br><br>
     <a class="fact11">#Fact.5 -</a><br><br><p class="fact1">Although it is much colder on Mars than on Earth, the similar tilt of Earth's and Mars' axes means they have similar seasons. Like Earth's, Mars' north and south polar caps shrink in the summer and grow in the winter. In addition, a day on Mars is 24 hours 37 minutes-nearly the same as Earth's. No other planet shares such similar characteristics with Earth.</p>
       <br>
       
       <br><br><br>
     <a class="fact11">#Fact.6 -</a><br><br><p class="fact1">Only 12 Martian meteors are known to exist on earth and are collectively called Shergotty-Nakhla-Chassingy or SNC ("snick") meteorites. The most famous one is called Allan Hills (ALH) 84001 and is believed to have blasted off Mars 16 million years ago, hitting Earth 13,000 years ago in Antarctica. It is so remarkable because it appears to hold microscopic fossils of Martian bacteria, sparking intense debate about whether ancient life ever existed on Mars.</p>
       <br>
       <img class="fact1img" src="Web/Spacefact6img.jpg"></img>
       <br><br><br>
     <a class="fact11">#Fact.7 -</a><br><br><p class="fact1">With no large moon like Earth's to stabilize it, Mars periodically tilts much more toward the sun, creating warmer summers on Mars than it otherwise would have.</p>
       <br> 
    
       <br><br><br>
     <a class="fact11">#Fact.8 -</a><br><br><p class="fact1">After six months, International Space Station astronauts return home having aged slightly less (0.007 seconds) than they would have if they had stayed on Earth. This is because space-time will bend depending on differences in either gravity or velocity - each of these affects time in different ways.</p>
       <br>
       <img class="fact1img" src="Web/Spacefact8img.jpg"></img>
       <br><br><br>
     <a class="fact11">#Fact.9 -</a><br><br><p class="fact1">Pluto is not on the edge of our solar system. The edge of our solar system is past the theorized Oort cloud, which, starting from Pluto, would take 10,000 years to reach. Pluto is barely one-fifty-thousandth of the way to the edge of the solar system.</p>
       <br>
       <img class="fact1img" src="Web/Spacefact9img.jpg"></img>
       <br><br><br>
     <a class="fact11">#Fact.10 -</a><br><br><p class="fact1">Pluto takes the longest time of the eight planets (248 Earth years) to orbit around the sun. Because it's the closest to the sun, Mercury has the fastest orbit, at 88 Earth days. Earth takes 365 days to orbit the sun.</p>
       <br>
     
       <br><br><br>
     <a class="fact11">#Fact.11 -</a><br><br><p class="fact1">After returning to Earth, many astronauts have a difficult time adjusting to gravity and often forget that things fall if you drop them.</p>
       <br>
       <img class="fact1img" src="Web/Spacefact11img.jpg"></img>
       <br><br><br>
     <a class="fact11">#Fact.12 -</a><br><br><p class="fact1">Saturn's moon Titan is a very noisy place. The sound of the wind on Titan is intensified because Titan's thick air conducts sound waves so well.</p>
       <br>
       <img class="fact1img" src="Web/Spacefact12img.jpg"></img>
       <br><br><br>
     <a class="fact11">#Fact.13 -</a><br><br><p class="fact1">Nobody knows how many stars there are in the Milky Way. Estimates range from 100 billion to 400 billion. And the Milky Way is just one of 140 billion galaxies, many of them larger than ours. Some astronomers argue that with such a large number of stars, it is very likely that the number of advanced civilizations in the Milky Way is probably in the millions.</p>
       <br>
       <img class="fact1img" src="Web/Spacefact13img.jpg"></img>
       <br><br><br>
     <a class="fact11">#Fact.14 -</a><br><br><p class="fact1">The first spacecraft to successfully land on Venus was the Soviet spaceship Venera 7, which reached the planet's surface on December 15, 1970. Several spacecraft had gone near the surface prior to this date, and the Soviet Venera 3 had crashed into the planet in 1966.</p>
       <br>
       <img class="fact1img" src="Web/Spacefact14img.jpg"></img>
       <br><br><br>
     <a class="fact11">#Fact.15 -</a><br><br><p class="fact1">The first American in space was Alan Shepherd, who was launched into space aboard Mercury 3 on May 5, 1961. His craft did not enter orbit, but it flew to a height of 116 miles and traveled 303 miles before safely parachuting into the Atlantic Ocean.</p>
       <br>
       <img class="fact1img" src="Web/Spacefact15img.jpg"></img>
       <br><br><br>
     <a class="fact11">#Fact.16 -</a><br><br><p class="fact1">A person could never get to the edge of the universe. If someone traveled outward in a straight line indefinitely, he would come back to where he began. The reason for this is that the universe bends, in a way that astronomers can't adequately imagine.</p>
       <br>
       
       <br><br><br>
     <a class="fact11">#Fact.17 -</a><br><br><p class="fact1">While scientists can describe and predict gravity, its source within matter is still unknown. Some scientists believe that infinitesimal particles called gravitons create the force. Scientists are also searching for gravitational waves, which would ground Albert Einstein's theory that the universe has a space-time "fabric.'</p>
       <br>
       <img class="fact1img" src="Web/Spacefact17img.jpg"></img>
       <br><br><br>
     <a class="fact11">#Fact.18 -</a><br><br><p class="fact1">Pluto is smaller than Mercury and seven other moons, including Ganymede, Titan, Callisto, Io, Europa, Triton, and Earth's moon.</p>
       <br>
    
       <br><br><br>
     <a class="fact11">#Fact.19 -</a><br><br><p class="fact1">Venus is often called Earth's twin because it is the closest planet in size to Earth. Scientists estimate the diameter of Venus at about 7,520 miles, making it approximately 400 miles smaller in diameter than Earth.</p>
       <br>
       <img class="fact1img" src="Web/Spacefact19img.jpg"></img>
       <br><br><br>
     <a class="fact11">#Fact.20 -</a><br><br><p class="fact1">No human could survive the low pressure of Mars. If you went to Mars without an appropriate space suit, the oxygen in your blood would literally turn into bubbles, causing immediate death.</p>
       <br>
       <img class="fact1img" src="Web/Spacefact20img.jpg"></img>
       <br><br><br>
     <a class="fact11">#Fact.21 -</a><br><br><p class="fact1">Venus and Mercury are the only two planets in the solar system that do not have any moons orbiting around them.</p>
       <br>
      
       <br><br><br>
     <a class="fact11">#Fact.22 -</a><br><br><p class="fact1">Venus was first observed from space on December 14, 1962, when an unmanned U.S. spacecraft called Mariner 2 passed within 21,600 miles of the planet after traveling through space for 3.5 months. It was the first of all the planets (with the exception of Earth) to be seen from space.</p> 
       <br>
       <img class="fact1img" src="Web/Spacefact22img.jpg"></img>
       <br><br><br> 
     <a class="fact11">#Fact.23 -</a><br><br><p class="fact1">On November 14, 1971, the United States' Mariner 9 was the first spacecraft to orbit Mars (or any other planet). After a massive dust storm cleared, Mariner 9 began transmitting nearly 73,000 images and revealing enormous volcanoes, huge canyons, frozen underground water in the form of permafrost, and what appeared to be dried-up river beds.</p>

       <img class="fact1img" src="Web/Spacefact23img.jpg"></img>
       <br><br><br>
     <a class="fact11">#Fact.24 -</a><br><br><p class="fact1">The ancient Greeks thought that Earth was the center of the universe and that Mars was one of the five traveling stars that revolved around it.</p> 
       <br>

       <br><br><br>
     <a class="fact11">#Fact.25 -</a><br><br><p class="fact1">About 20 light years from Earth is star BPM 37093 (a.k.a. Lucy, after the Beatles' song "Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds"). This white dwarf is actually one huge diamond that weighs in at 10 billion trillion trillion carats and is about the size of our moon.</p>

       <span id="dots">...</span><span id="more"> 
     <a class="fact11">#Fact.26 -</a><br><br><p class="fact1">The first human in space was Soviet cosmonaut<b> Yuri Gagarin</b>, who orbited Earth in Vostok 1 in 1961. The following year, American astronaut John Glenn, Jr., became the first American to orbit Earth. American Neil Armstrong was the first human being to set foot on the moon in 1969.</p>

       <br><br><br>
     <a class="fact11">#Fact.27 -</a><br><br><p class="fact1">The most distant known objects in our universe are quasars, which are matter breaking apart as it spirals into a black hole. The nearest one is billions of light years away.

The reason we exist in this one is that we could exist in it. If gravity were fractionally stronger or weaker, if the expansion happed just a little more slowly or swiftly, then there might not have been stable elements from which to make humans beings.</p>
